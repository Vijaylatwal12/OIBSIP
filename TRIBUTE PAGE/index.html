            <p><b>As a child, Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995, where his father was the kit man,
                and later spent two years with Nacional. In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP,
                who signed him for a fee of £1,500. He subsequently moved from Madeira to Alcochete, near Lisbon,
                to join Sporting's youth academy.By age 14, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play
                semi-professionally and agreed with his mother to cease his education to focus entirely on football.</p>
                Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise multiple cardiac pathways into one,
                 altering his resting heart rate.
                 He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed training a few days later.</b></p>

        <h3>SPORTING</h3>
        <img class="image" src="sporting.webp" alt="Ronaldo pic">
        <p><b>At age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team manager László Bölöni, 
            who was impressed with his dribbling.He subsequently became the first player to play for the club's under-16,
            under-17 and under-18 teams, the B team and the first team, all within a single season.
            <br>
            Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was determined to acquire Ronaldo on a permanent move urgently,
             after Sporting defeated United 3–1 at the inauguration of the Estádio José Alvalade in August 2003.

            <b>
            Ronaldo's move to Manchester United was completed on 12 August 2003, too late for the 2003 FA Community Shield 
            but in time for their game against Bolton Wanderers on the opening day of the 2003–04 season, and made him the 
            first Portuguese player to sign for the club. His transfer fee made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager 
            in English football history. Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the squad number
             7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham.
             Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo.A key element in his development during
              his time in England proved to be Ferguson, of whom he later said:
             "He's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career."

            record following a transfer, overtaking Messi after his move to Paris Saint-Germain.

            Ronaldo began his international career with Portugal under-15 in 2001. During his international youth career,
            Ronaldo would represent the under-15, under-17, under-20,
            under-21 and under-23 national sides, amassing 34 youth caps and scoring 18 goals overall.
            Ronaldo scored twice in Portugal's first game of Euro 2020, a 3–0 win against Hungary in Budapest
            This took him to a total of eleven European Championship goals, two clear of Michel Platini, 
            as the all-time top goalscorer in the competition's history.[387] He also became the first player
            to score at five European Championships,
            and in eleven consecutive tournaments.
            Ronaldo scored two headed goals, with his second coming seconds before the full-time whistle, 
            in a 2–1 home win against the Republic of Ireland in a World Cup qualifier at the Estádio Algarve, 
            which saw him pass Ali Daei's international record of 109 goals to become the sole record holder.

            with his 181st international appearance, he also overtook Sergio Ramos's record for the most international
